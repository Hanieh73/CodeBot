# robot-friend

You don't have a rubber duck to help you debug your code? No problem! I have made a digital robot to help you debug your code. You can talk to CodeBot, your coding buddy, as much as you want. So no more excuses to not debug your code! If bored, do some hovering :)

I have practiced CSS in this project by making the robot to be able to blink as well as a number of different body movements when you hover on top of different elements.

This project has been deployed using netlify and can be accessed directly by clicking on the link below:
